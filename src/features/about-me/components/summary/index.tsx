          My journey in tech started with a deep interest in creating
          user-friendly and visually appealing interfaces, which I&apos;ve honed
          through various projects, including building responsive and modern
          websites. In addition to my frontend expertise, I also have solid
          experience in backend development, particularly with Golang and
          Nest.js.
